# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

# what is != and where should you use it?
# Does not equal

# put ! before something, like !user_name
# opposite of its boolean

# put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# for some methods, this will tell it to mutate the caller

# put ? before something
# if/else statement

# put ? after something
# name of the method

# put !! before something, like !!user_name
# turn it into its boolean
