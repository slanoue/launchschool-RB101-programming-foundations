# Goal of these lessons:
# * Build fluency in language syntax
# * Learn to think like a programmer
# * Learn to build web applications
# * Debugging mindset

# We'll cover a lot of areas, but you can categorize them into 3 main buckets:
# * Learning to program procedurally (e.g. grammar/syntax)
# * Object oriented programming
# * Other stuff (e.g. testing, blocks, tools, problem solving, developing familiarity with the language)

# Learning to code vs. learning to program:
# * First, Ruby grammar & syntax (e.g. English grammar/vocabulary)
# * Second, building applications (e.g. writing essays/novels)
# * Very frustrating to jump between the two when you're first learning
# * Use pseudo code to help with this challenge

# Looking for help:
# * Search using the "right phrases" (Use the stack trace, read error messages, add "ruby" to your search)
# * Stack Overflow
# * Ruby docs (not Rails docs)
